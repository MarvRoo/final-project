Enter the number of where you want to go:
[Pull players function shareRoomListPtr() to get the pointer 
to the players string vector of listed rooms and print them out by index+1]
[After the name is checked you also have to check that keyItemFound is true, if true then even though room is because...
    Thoughts and explanation:
    Location after keyitemfound becomes true but the room is not locked since its been unlocked by game progress
    If a location is locked and keyItemfound is false then that means that location has not come up in the story
    If location us unlocked and keyItemfound is false then that means the location hasn't been visited]
[Include edge cases for invalid input of vector index.]
Enter :
[When the player enters a number you have to -1 whatever number 
they entered to know which index they picked. Then the string they picked compare to Locationlibrary
to find the right location checking the location object name variable.]

You go to...
    [location name pulled from vector]
    [Print room fixed descript string from location object]
    [Add location clues found to Player]
    [Mark keyItemFound as true]
