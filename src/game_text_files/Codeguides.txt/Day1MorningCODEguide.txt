Story Characters in Game:

Angie (Sitter) 
The Gardener
Sheriff
Pool Boy

The story begins:
You, Jacob, and Dr. Lou, returned home from a 3 week vacation from Barbados. You wanted to find the house sitter, Angie, to ask her what she's been up to. Your really good friends. Where should we search first?
    [If player doesn't go straight to backyard check branch will be called later to check that]
    [call Location description]
+goToLocation

[+CheckBranch This line means to check the called previous location and if it's
not the main branch of the story then print out the following text. Job for GameLoop]

+CheckBranch{
    [Name of the location we want the player to get to]
    Backyard
    [check returned string from goToLocation to see if its the string name we need to continue the story]
but it looks like the sitter isn't here...
    [While string name returned is not Backyard]
    +goToLocation if we're not in the main story branch
    [Code loop here of goToLocation]
+end}

[if we're at backyard story follows]
Thoughts and explanation on how these files work: 
    [Dialogue for calling the sheiff mom
    Now I'll make point choices
    When a choice is made it pushes the dialogue container as it is rn 
    pushes the choice contianer and from now maps the rest of this text file as continuing
    The printer function dialogue should be calling the interfaces within its saved string and not printing the 
    actual strings +acquire or +location
    THE PRINTER CLASS handles the vector of dialogue and choice objects ]
As you make your way to the backyard you notice the grass is uncut and...a trail of blood that leads to the shed.
