Angie
Single gun shot wound to the head. Mallet was used to mislead the cause of death. Fingerprints located on body. Fingerprints show less ridge density suggesting the killer is most likely male.

Gardener
Fingerprint taken, with no match to the fingerprint on Angie. Found dead in the downstairs bathroom from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Suspicious suicide.
