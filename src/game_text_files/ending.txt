Good End-Moving Away
Jacob was arrested on second degree murder charges. Mom and I decided to move away as a way of starting over...but it's not like you'll forget. To think you almost believed he was innocent. At your feet a shoe box with Jac-..no Dad's gun, despite everything you feel safer with it then without. You haven't been able to get a wink of sleep without it under your pillow. Sweet...sweet dreams?

Bad End-Liar Liar your hand's on fire
Jealous much? Apparently you were so jealous and hurt over her always taking stuff from your room. One thing let to another and you wanted to scare her but instead you pulled the trigger...Didn't think it was loaded did ya? Naw Jacob like's to show it off from time to time so it was locked and loaded. You plead insanity.
