    *They both arrive to find you shaken as you lead them to the backyard and into the shed.

Dr. Lou: "Jesus..."

    The Sheiff loosens his tie looking at angie pitifully but annoyed*

Sheriff: "Maybe...cover her eyes."
Dr. Lou: "Maybe? Shouldn't you be calling for backup?! Ally you should've called 911 first!"
Me: "I panicked! I was the only who got here! This looks bad...on me."
Sheriff: "I don't understand why you called me!? God dammit I'm a week away from retirement!"

    He rubs his eyes vigoriously*

Sheriff: "If I have to arrest someone it'd have to be you, at least for questioning...I can't afford another blank case."
Sheriff: "Another dead case...and my pension is on the line..."
Dr. Lou: "So what we have to do your work for you!?"
Sheriff: "I don't know you want me to arrest her? That's the easiest thing to do right now."
Dr. Lou: "...useless, It's okay Ally we're going to figure this out."

    Her reassurance lacks confidence...Are you ready to prove your innocence?

Sheriff: "Alright, all you detectives."

    The sheriffs hurries back outside the shed and you begin the investigation with Dr.Lou.

Dr. Lou: "Well I guess I'll start writing a report we can reference...autopsy report. She has blunt force trauma to the head."

    Dr. Lou crouches carefully scanning the tarp*

Dr.Lou: "I think these are fingerprints and theres a trail of blood coming into the shed...likely she was unconscious or dragged in here already dead. 
+stringClues{
"Blood behind her head"
"Fingerprints found on bloody tarp”
“Body found on tarp in the shed”
+end}
Me: "Yeah...I'll make now of all those things..."
Sheriff: "Well well well, come take a look at who showed up!"

    Stepping out the shed you see the Sheriff eying down the pool boy.

Sheriff: "He says he just came back from his lunch break ey."
Pool Boy: "I swear I finished cleaning up the pool a little early so I thought I could go get my lunch before my next job ya know. I'd come back and fill the pool up I swear! I was bailing on the job, please forgive me."

    You look around at the backyard and past the pool boy to see if the pool is empty like he said after all.

    Sheriff nods*

Sheriff: "I'd say we aought to give them an interagation-"
Me: "Uh more like an interview, no one's being accused without proof."

    Sheriff shrugs*

Sheriff: "Either you or them so get to it."

Things sure look grim, better clear your name and quick.
