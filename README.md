## Project Description
 > **We choose the text-based role-playing game for our project because we wanted to gain hands on experience of what’s it’s like to create a game and to understand the complexities that comes along with it. Making a PRG project will allow us to enhance our current understanding of C++ concepts such as polymorphism, inheritance, and classes and how to apply it to a real-life programming situation. We also like that it’s a throwback to a horror style game that became popular a couple of years ago in 2015-2017. So it would be fun and interesting to create a story of our own.**
 > **We plan to complete the project with C++. We will work in VS Studio Code and use tools like the GDB debugger to aid in the process. For communication and smooth efficiency in implementing features, we will rely on GitHub for pull requests and utilize the project board to aid in task management.**  
> **Inputs of our project will include: inputing a letter (ex. a,b,c,d)  to  select a specific hint/clue (a character's testimony or an item used by the characters), asking for player's input to select who they think the murderer is, and inputing how many hearts to see how many chances they have left before they loose the game from not selecting the correct murderer. Outputs of our project will include: outputing the character's testimonies or the item's clue, outputing if the player was right or wrong from guessing who the murderer is, the number of chances they have left before they loose, and outputing who the murderer is if the player wasn't able to guess correctly.**

> **Features include saved inputs to save game progress when a player dies so they don’t restart the game. We’ll create a concise, engaging narrative with a clear goal or questline. Along with it we hope to be able to create a simple interface messenger look still remaining text based to immerse the user better. There will be characters created that will need to have their own dialogue. We will be using multiple classes and functions to help bring this to life.**

### Screen Layouts
> The layout of the project will be text based where the user will be expected to give input, expect output (from character testimonials for example), and recieve character insights to help solve the game via dialogue on the screen. Because it is text based, players are able to interact with this game using the linux or VS Code terminal. During the start of each day, the screen will output some context of the main occurrence that has happened. Players are able to search for clues in the locations given by inputing 'c'  and move in different locations by inputing the specific location. As the player moves to a certain location, the screen will then output where the player is currently is. Players are also given the option to interview potential suspects by being prompted with a question on the screen if they want to interview them. In addition, users are also able conduct analysis about who the suspect could be after being prompted with the character's dialogue when selecting the choice of speaking to them or when choosing who they think the suspect is. At the end of each day, players will be given a recap of all the clues they have garnered and will be expected to input a character to interview the next day.

> BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history.
>  * Each team member should also submit the Peer Evaluation Form on Canvas for this final phase. In this form, you need to fill in the names of all team members, the percentage of work contributed by each member for the final phase, and a description of their contributions. Remember that each team member should submit the form individually.
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
