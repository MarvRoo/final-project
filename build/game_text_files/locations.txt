Tarp
Mallet
+end
The shed walls hold up neat rows of tools. One big item noticeably missing. It doesn't take long...a bloody mallet against the wall near Lana, the sitter's body. She's face down sprawled on a tarp that covers the whole floor with her hands beneath her. The back of her head matted with crusted blood.

"Missing Mop"

The walls are painted a pale yellow and drawers and cupboards white. Looks pretty clean and well kept as far as you can tell. Nothing out of place it seems, the floor looks like it's just been mopped but no mop in sight.

"Uncut Grass"
The flowers are lively but a little overgrown. The grass is uncut it's really time for a trim. Strange the gardener was suppose to mow and trim today early in the morning.

What usually is a crystal clear pool for a good summer day is now bere white walls sinking 12 ft down. It's a kidney shaped pool with one set of stairs. A pool noodle lies near the edge, it has a stain...might be blood.

The living rooms curtains closed make the living room more depressing despite the house plants all around. Looking around you spot some blood on the carpet...along with Angie's phone on the coffee table. Dead.

Jacobs's Gun
"Gun is missing 2 bullets now."
Badge
+end
The bathroom floor becomes messier by the second as you peer from behind the sheriff's back. The gun shot fired woke you up so now you stand in the dimly lit downstairs bathroom. Usually messier since it's closer to jacobs room but now slumped against the tub is the gardener with a gun in his right hand.

Posters from bands my brother likes plastered on almost ever inch of the wall. Nothing particularly out of place..then you notice the wooden chest inside the top shelf in the closet. After Dad died Jacob got to keep his revolver. He always says in case of an intruder it's better to keep it within reach...He might have been right. Poor Angie.
