Day 1 Night

As hours passed you, the Gardner, the Pool boy, and the Sheriff spend most of the day in the living. Every now and then contemplating living, the stress of it all duanting on you. For dinner...pizza like some makeshift pizza party. Your apetite is really low so you spend most of the time pondering. All you can do for now is suspect the people in this house...in particular was it the Gardener? The Pool Boy? Mmmm decisons decisions...decisions.

Sheriff: I'll stay here with these two through the night so you don't have to worry your pretty little head!"

    The Sheriff doesn't find your tone very funny and gives you a long stare down before walking away*

Me: "...too soon for jokes I guess."

    I wasn't joking.*

Pool Boy: "Do you mind if I borrow you-your phone?"
Me: "...Sure. Who are you going to call?"
Pool Boy: "My friend..since I was stuck here I asked him to take on my job for me."
    
    He looks over pointedly to the Sheriff whose already dozing off*

Pool Boy: He didn't let us charge our phones when they died...

"Sorry..I'll let you borrow mine before I go to bed."

"Mmm might be for the best...sorry."

    Hanging his head he retreats to the couches in the living room.*

As cruel as it may sound their phone calls aren't jack shit to a life sentence in prison so no chance...
Theough out of the both of them only one feels annoyingly cleared. Maybe it's paranoia talking...

    The Gardener huddles on the using his sweater as blanket. Neither him or the Pool Boy seem to keen on converation. And the Sheriff? Knocked out..so much for keeping watch.

Me: What was Angie laying on top of?
Tarp
Me: What might be the murder weapon?
Mallet
Me: What makes me think the Mallet is the murder weapon?

"Missing Mop"
Me: Yep and the floor looked like it was freshly...
"The floor was freshly mopped..."
Me: Where was Angie found?
"Body found on tarp in the shed"

Me: Between the two interviews Pool Boy and Gardener...which do I believe more?
Pool Boy's Interview
Me: He came back so naturally, I know what they say about killers returning to the scene of the crime but I just don't think it's him. Whose interview is too strong?
