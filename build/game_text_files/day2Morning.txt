Day 2 Morning

You wake up to the smell of toast and eggs. A familiar smell and comfort until it dawns on you what lays in the shed. You really slept so soundly didn't you? Only a small hint of guilt before you shake it off and get up.

    As you walk downstairs your head start to get lighter and your vision dims...or is it getting darker outside?*
        
        Your vision clears and from the bottom of the steps you realize now it's completely dark...am I sleep walking?*

Adjacent to the living room, your house has a small hallway to another bedroom, your brother's Room, and a bathroom across from it. Very convient for him, since he was the oldest he got the first pick.

    BANG!*
        CRACK!

You wake up startled hands to your heart almost falling off the bed as you look around your room frantically. Listening for any signs that what you heard was a part of the dream...

    Rushed footsteps from down the hall*
    
    Chatter in the Downstairs Bathroom*

    You don't head downstairs until you hear Dr. Lou's voice boom*

Dr. Lou: "Are you serious!!"
Sheriff: "The bastard done, done himself in...well shit."
Dr. Low: "I don't know this doesn't look like it was on purpose."

    Dr.Lou starts to inspect the Gardener putting her ear up to his mouth and checking his pulse*

    You feel a precense behind your back and a shiver runs up you’re spice*

Jacob: "Is that my gun!"

Dr. Lou cocks her head*

Dr. Lou: “Your right it is…”

Jacob: “He was in my room! I was looking for it right now thinking we’re getting robbed-“

Dr. Lou: “I’m more shocked he knew what it was…we were all sleeping like the dead.”

Jacob: “I don’t know I’ve never told anyone where I keep it-“

Me: “In the closet in a box that’s where you keep it.”

Jacob: “…Have you been in my room?”

Jacob: “…Well I didn’t hear him come in I was knocked out asleep.”

Me: “what time is it?”

Sheriff: “Hey is that my badge!!!”

    He touches his uniform to make sure and snatches it up from the Gardener’s grasp.*

Dr. Lou: "It's barely morning the sunny isn't fully out. 6:30 am."
